## 1. Select Satellite Functionality (Select TLE)

### Description:

- Allows the user to upload TLE files and visualize satellites.
- Satellites can be selected by **Name** or **Catalog Number** for additional operations.
- File names and colors are used for visual differentiation.

### Steps:

1. Navigate to the **`Testing/SelectSatellite_Testing`** folder.
2. Upload the required TLE file:
   - **File**: `Starlink_20231116160005.txt` (TLE file for testing).
   - Use the **Insert TLE List** option in the GUI to populate the satellites.
3. Open the **Select TLE by Name** or **Select TLE by Catalog** options in the GUI:
   - **For Name**:
     - Upload `SelectTLE_Testing_ByName.txt` (formatted as `satelliteName,R,G,B`).
   - **For Catalog**:
     - Upload `SelectTLE_Testing_ByCatalog.txt` (formatted as `catalogNumber,R,G,B`).
4. Verify visualization:
   - Selected satellites appear with their assigned colors.
   - If a satellite does not have a color in the file, it defaults to `[200, 200, 200]`.
5. Toggle Satellite Orbit Lines:
   - In the **Display** section of the GUI, enable or disable **Orbit Lines**.

### Expected Results:

- Satellites from the uploaded TLE file populate the selection dialog.

## 3. Multi-TLE File Handling

### Description:

- Supports uploading multiple TLE files for satellites.
- Files are sorted by **epoch time** and dynamically switched during the simulation based on the current time.

### Steps:

1. Navigate to the **`Testing/MultiTLE_Testing`** folder.
2. Upload multiple TLE files via the **Insert TLE List** option.
   - Files should have timestamps in their names, e.g., `Starlink_20231101000000.txt`.
3. Enable the **Start from Present Time** toggle or keep it off:
   - **Enabled**: The simulation uses the current system time.
   - **Disabled**: The simulation uses the epoch time of the first satellite in the file.
4. Adjust the simulation time using the **Time Warp** feature:
   - Increase/decrease warp size to observe dynamic switching.
5. Verify:
   - Files are sorted by timestamp.
   - The system switches files based on the simulation time.

### Expected Results:

- TLE files are correctly sorted by timestamp.
- Dynamic switching occurs between TLE files as the simulation time progresses.

### File Location for Testing:

- TLE Files:
  - `Testing/MultiTLE_Testing/Starlink_20231101000000.txt`
  - `Testing/MultiTLE_Testing/Starlink_20231102000000.txt`

## 4. Shortest Path Visualization

### Description:

- Renders precomputed shortest paths between satellites at different timestamps.
- Uses input files that specify paths over time.
- By default, the simulation starts at the **epoch time** of the first satellite in the uploaded **TLE file**.
- The displayed shortest path updates dynamically based on **time wrapping**.

### Steps:

1. Navigate to the **`Testing/Shortest_Path_Testing`** folder.

2. **Upload the Required TLE File**:

   - **File**: `Starlink_70_20231030160003.txt`
   - Upload it via **Insert TLE List** in the GUI.
   - This initializes the satellites in the system.

3. **Upload the Shortest Path File**:

   - **File**: `shortestpath.txt`
   - Upload it in the **Shortest Path Visualization** section of the GUI.
   - The file should have the following format:
     ```
     timestamp,satellite1,satellite2,satellite3,â€¦
     2023-10-30T13:00:00Z,55275,55279,55277,55400
     ```
   - This file contains **precomputed shortest paths** for specific timestamps.

4. **Verify Initial Path Visualization**:

   - The system reads `shortestpath.txt` in **ShortestPathFile.js**.
   - The parsed data is stored in an array `shortestPaths[]`:
     - `shortestPaths[i].timestamp` holds the timestamp.
     - `shortestPaths[i].satelliteIds` holds the ordered satellite path.
   - The **correct shortest path** should be drawn between the satellites at the current simulation time.

5. **Use Time Warp to Observe Path Changes**:

   - Enable **Time Warp** in the **Time** section.
   - Adjust the **warp size** to move through different timestamps.
   - As time progresses, the system updates the displayed shortest path.
   - The function `visualizeShortestPaths()`:
     - Selects the closest timestamp in `shortestpath.txt`.
     - Updates the displayed path accordingly.

6. **Confirm Path Transitions**:
   - If the simulation time is **before the first timestamp**, the **first path** in the file is used.
   - If the simulation time is **after the last timestamp**, the **last path** in the file is used.
   - If the simulation time is **between two timestamps**, the **closest available path** is displayed.
   - Ensure smooth transitions of paths as time progresses.

### Expected Results:

- The **shortest path updates dynamically** based on simulation time.
- Paths change as **Time Warp** progresses.
- The correct sequence of satellites is highlighted.
- If no valid timestamp is found, **no path is displayed**.

## 5. Start from Present Time or Epoch Time

### Description:

- Determines the starting time for the simulation:
  - **Start from Present Time**: Uses the system clock.
  - **Start from Epoch Time**: Uses the epoch of the first satellite in the uploaded TLE file.

### Steps:

1. Upload the required TLE file using **Insert TLE List**.
2. Toggle **Start from Present Time** in the **Time** section:
   - **Enabled**: The system clock is used.
   - **Disabled**: The epoch time of the first satellite is used.
3. Verify time progression in the GUI.

### Expected Results:

- **Enabled**: The simulation time matches the system clock.
- **Disabled**: The simulation starts from the first satellite's epoch.

### Steps:

1. Enable the **Time Warp** feature in the **Time** section.
2. Adjust the warp size (in seconds).
3. Observe the effect on satellite motion and file switching.

### Expected Results:

- Time progression speeds up or slows down based on the warp size.

## 6. Toggle Satellite Orbit Lines

### Steps:

1. Upload the required TLE file as described in **Select Satellite Functionality**.
2. In the **Display** section of the GUI, locate the **Orbit Lines** toggle option.
3. Toggle **Orbit Lines** on or off to control the visibility of the orbit paths for selected satellites.
