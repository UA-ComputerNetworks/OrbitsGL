/**
 * computeOrbitalState - Computes the current state vector (position and velocity) of a satellite.
 *
 * This function calculates the satellite's current position and velocity using its TLE data and SGP4 model.
 * The Orbital State Vector (OSV) includes the satellite's position in a Cartesian coordinate system and
 * its velocity vector.
 *
 * How it works:
 * - The SGP4 model is used to propagate the satellite's position and velocity from its TLE data.
 *
 * @param {object} satrec - Satellite record generated from the TLE data.
 * @param {number} time - The time in seconds since the satellite's epoch.
 * @returns {object} - The OSV object containing position and velocity vectors.
 *
 * Usage Example:
 * ```js
 * const osv = Orbits.computeOrbitalState(satrec, currentTime);
 * console.log(osv.position, osv.velocity);
 * ```
 *
 * Important Details:
 * - Ensure the satellite's TLE data is accurate for precise orbit propagation.
 * - This function is called regularly to update the satellite's position in real-time.

/**
 * propagateOrbit - Propagates the satellite's orbit for a specific time.
 *
 * This function propagates the satellite's orbit using its current orbital elements, updating its position
 * and velocity at the specified time. It also handles orbit plotting.
 *
 * How it works:
 * - Uses the satellite's orbital elements to propagate its orbit over time.
 * - Plots the orbit based on the propagated positions.
 *
 * @param {object} satrec - Satellite record generated from the TLE data.
 * @param {number} deltaTime - The time step for orbit propagation.
 *
 * Usage Example:
 * ```js
 * Orbits.propagateOrbit(satrec, 60); // Propagate orbit for 60 seconds
 * ```
 *
 * Important Details:
 * - This function is useful for plotting satellite orbits over a specified time period.

 * plotOrbit - Plots the satellite's orbit in the 3D scene.
 *
 * This function takes the propagated orbital state vector (OSV) and plots the satellite's orbit
 * as a line in 3D space. It is used for real-time orbit visualization.
 *
 * How it works:
 * - Draws the satellite's orbit in the 3D WebGL scene based on its position.
 * - Updates the orbit path dynamically as the satellite moves.
 *
 * @param {object} osv - Orbital State Vector containing position and velocity of the satellite.
 *
 * Usage Example:
 * ```js
 * Orbits.plotOrbit(osv);
 * ```
 *
 * Important Details:
 * - This function is used in conjunction with the `computeOrbitalState` and `propagateOrbit` functions
 *   to provide real-time orbit visualization.

 * convertToKeplerian - Converts the Orbital State Vector (OSV) to Keplerian elements.
 *
 * This function converts the satellite's position and velocity (OSV) into classical Keplerian elements,

 *
 * How it works:
 * - Uses the satellite's position and velocity to compute Keplerian elements such as eccentricity,
 *   semi-major axis, and inclination.
 *
 * @param {object} osv - Orbital State Vector containing position and velocity of the satellite.
 * @returns {object} - Keplerian elements describing the satellite's orbit.
 *
 * Usage Example:
 * ```js
 * const keplerianElements = Orbits.convertToKeplerian(osv);
 * console.log(keplerianElements);
 * ```
 *
 * Important Details:
 * - Keplerian elements are important for understanding the satellite's orbital characteristics.
